However, if you have supporting documents or relevant evidence <strong>already in your possession</strong>, you can upload copies here.  Documents will be held on our secure server before being passed to our office teams.   Below is a list of examples of documents that will help us make a decision.  Please only send us documents related to the circumstances of your claim or the medical condition(s) you are claiming for.

<li><strong>Service documents</strong> but only if they directly support your claim, for example accident report forms, hurt certificates, incident reports.</li>
<li><strong>Medical test results</strong> including reports from scans, audiology and x-rays (but not the x-rays themselves).  We do not require images of your condition/illness unless you have a specific reason to send these to us.</li>
<li><strong>Letters about other compensation received for the conditions</strong> you are claiming for on this application, including criminal injuries compensation and civil negligence compensation.</li>
<li><strong>Documents showing legal authority to act on behalf of others</strong>, if you are making this application on behalf of someone else.</li>
